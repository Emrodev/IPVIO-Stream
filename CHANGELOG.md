# Changelog

## Unreleased
**Playlists (T-009)**
- Xtream: any number of backup server addresses per login (same username and password). If the main server stops answering, the app switches to the next one by itself, for the playlist, TV guide, catch-up and streams
- Each server shows whether it is reachable or since when it is not; the playlist row in Settings > Playlists lists servers that are down
- Backup servers are included in the backup export and import
- Internal: player helper code split from Media3 (no user-visible change).
**Playlists**
- Stalker/Ministra portals load movie and series categories on demand: the first load fetches all channels plus the newest page of each category, further titles come when a category is opened, previewed or scrolled (PR #7)
- Stalker: movies with their own files (`has_files`) play, relative covers are shown, channels in movie-named genres stay in Live TV (PR #7)
- Stalker: a portal that only echoes the requested command no longer yields a broken play address, and a portal that ignores `movie_id` no longer plays the first movie of a category instead; movie and series categories with the same name keep separate title counts (follow-up to PR #7)
- Stalker: movies and episodes play on more portals: several `create_link` request forms, addresses from `url`, relative paths or `play_token`, file lookup for episodes, a new login when the portal rejects the session, a short wait on HTTP 429; when nothing plays, the error shows a masked summary of the portal's answer (Stalker part of PR #19)

## 1.3
[PENDING: Änderung eintragen]

## 1.2
**Removed**
- Optional backup to Google Drive (sign-in with a code). Planned again for 1.4 as LiveSync. The old code is in tag V1.1

**Live TV**
- Fewer stalls when opening Live TV on Android TV / Fire TV: genres and quality bundling are prepared in the background (PR #8); follow-up fixes make sure a category never shows the rows of the previously selected category while bundling runs, and a failed background preparation falls back to the plain channel rows instead of crashing
**Playlists**
- Stalker/Ministra portals: movies and episodes play again. For movies and episodes the app tries several `create_link` request forms, reads the address from `url` and `cmd` (also relative paths and `play_token` answers), looks up the title's own file when needed, and logs in again when the portal rejects the session (PR #19)
- Stalker: a `create_link` answer with an error (e.g. `nothing_to_play`) or a bare video club command no longer counts as a play address, so the file lookup still runs; a file list that is really a whole category no longer starts another title; after a timeout, "429 Too Many Requests" or the account's stream limit no further request forms are sent; live channels log in again once after a failed start, as before PR #19 (follow-up to PR #19)

## 1.1
**Updates and your data**
- In-app updates from GitHub Releases: the app checks once a day and shows "Update available" in the bell; one click downloads and installs
- Release signing via `keystore.properties` (see docs/RELEASE.md) so updates install over the old version and keep history, favorites and settings

**Playlists**
- Xtream: if `get.php` fails or returns no playlist (e.g. custom error codes like 884), the app loads the account through `player_api.php` automatically
- Several playlists at the same time: "Also show" in Settings > Playlists; movies and series merged (duplicate movies once, same series as one series with several sources), "Source" filter in Movies/Series, source switch in Live TV
- Stalker/Ministra portals (portal address + MAC): live channels and movies
- M3U file from the device (file picker) or uploaded from the phone page

**Live TV**
- Rewind live TV (optional on-device buffer, 256 MB – 2 GB), pause without missing anything, "Back to live"
- Record the current show (from the buffer, no second connection), storage internal or USB, recordings list in Live TV
- Endless reconnect for live streams, automatic reconnect when the server ends a stream
- New "Sports" section: sports live now and coming up (from the TV guide), all sports channels

**Player**
- MPEG-DASH (.mpd) streams; unsupported formats show a message instead of crashing

**Interface**
- View options moved from the header to Settings > View, with a live preview of card size and artwork
- Sidebar on the left, right or top; icons only or always with text
- Phones: landscape by default, tap for controls, double-tap left/right to skip

**Sports, playlists, second stream**
- Sports hub with filters: sport (football, basketball, tennis, F1, MMA, ...) and time (now, today, tomorrow, next 48 h)
- In the Live TV list you can switch the playlist (or "All playlists") without going into the settings
- Second stream in the live player: picture-in-picture or split screen, sound from either stream, swap streams. Arrangement, window size (4 sizes) and corner are saved (Settings > Player > Second stream)

**Phone search**
- New button at the bottom of the sidebar: shows a QR code. Scan it and search movies, series and live channels on your phone (a web page served by the TV, same Wi-Fi, nothing to install). Tap a result to play it on the TV; pause, skip, stop and volume buttons included

**Languages**
- Dutch (Nederlands) is the 10th language

**Metadata**
- Own API keys for TMDB and OMDb in Settings > API keys
- Without keys: description, cover, rating, genres, running time and trailer straight from the Xtream provider
- OMDb ratings also without TMDB (lookup by title and year)
- Rating order for sorting and "Top rated": IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, TMDB, provider

**Interface (new)**
- Settings > View rebuilt: 5 tabs (cards, sidebar, grid, home, categories) with a live preview of every option
- New "Donate" card in the settings (PayPal link and QR code)

**Transfer**
- Transfer history, favorites and settings to another device over Wi-Fi (optionally with playlists)
- QR codes: scan instead of typing the address (add playlist from phone, Wi-Fi transfer, Google sign-in)
- Settings > About: optional donation link (PayPal) with QR code
- Much faster loading of large Xtream accounts: series episodes are fetched when a series is opened instead of 50,000 requests while loading
- Optional backup to Google Drive (sign-in with a code, see docs/GOOGLE_DRIVE.md)
- Read the last crash report on the phone (no clipboard needed)
